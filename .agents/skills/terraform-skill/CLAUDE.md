## What This Is

This repository contains a **Claude Code skill** - executable documentation that Claude loads to provide Terraform/OpenTofu expertise. Think of it as:

- **Prompt engineering as infrastructure**: Version-controlled AI instructions
- **Domain knowledge artifact**: Encoding terraform-best-practices.com into Claude's context
- **Meta-project**: Building instructions for an AI assistant

## How Claude Skills Work

### Progressive Disclosure

```
User: "Create a Terraform module with tests"
       ↓
Claude: Scans skill metadata (~100 tokens)
       ↓
Claude: "This matches terraform-skill activation triggers"
       ↓
Claude: Loads full SKILL.md (~4,400 tokens)
       ↓
Claude: Applies testing framework decision matrix
       ↓
Response: Code following best practices
```

**Key Insight:** Skills only load when relevant, minimizing token usage.

### Token Budget

- **Metadata (YAML frontmatter):** ~100 tokens - always loaded
- **Core SKILL.md:** ~4,400 tokens - loaded on activation
- **Reference files:** Individual estimates (loaded on demand only):
  - ci-cd-workflows.md: ~2,300 tokens
  - code-patterns.md: ~5,100 tokens
  - module-patterns.md: ~7,000 tokens
  - quick-reference.md: ~3,800 tokens
  - security-compliance.md: ~2,500 tokens
  - testing-frameworks.md: ~3,400 tokens
- **Target:** Aim for under 500 lines for main SKILL.md (current: 524 lines - comprehensive core guidance)

**Our Architecture:**
- SKILL.md: 524 lines, ~4.4K tokens (comprehensive core guidance)
- Reference files: 6 files totaling 4,091 lines, ~26K tokens
- Progressive disclosure: ~56-70% token reduction for typical queries (vs loading all content)

## Content Philosophy

### What Belongs in SKILL.md

✅ **Include:**
- Terraform-specific patterns and idioms
- Decision frameworks (when to use X vs Y)
- Version-specific features (Terraform 1.6+, 1.9+, etc.)
- Testing strategy workflows
- ✅ DO vs ❌ DON'T examples
- Quick reference tables and decision matrices

✅ **Keep:**
- Scannable format (tables, headers, visual hierarchy)
- Imperative voice ("Use X", not "You should consider X")
- Concrete examples with inline comments
- Version requirements clearly marked

### What Doesn't Belong

❌ **Exclude:**
- Generic programming advice
- Terraform syntax basics (covered in official docs)
- Provider-specific resource details (use MCP tools)
- Obvious practices ("use version control")
- Long prose explanations (use tables instead)

## Content Structure

SKILL.md is organized by workflow phase:

1. **When to Use This Skill** - Activation triggers for Claude
2. **Core Principles** - Naming, structure, philosophy
3. **Testing Strategy Framework** - Decision matrices
4. **Module Development** - Best practices and patterns
5. **Common Patterns** - ✅/❌ side-by-side examples
6. **CI/CD Integration** - Workflow automation
7. **Quick Reference** - Rapid consultation tables
8. **License & Attribution** - Legal and source credits

Each section is self-contained for selective reading.

## Writing Style Guide

### Imperative Voice

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Use underscores in variable names, not hyphens:

✅ DO: `variable "vpc_id" {}`
❌ DON'T: `variable "vpc-id" {}`
```

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
You should consider using underscores instead of hyphens
in your variable names, as this is generally preferred.
```

### Scannable Format

Use:
- **Tables** for comparisons and decision matrices
- **Code blocks** with inline comments
- **Headers** for clear section breaks
- **Bullets** for lists, not paragraphs
- **✅/❌** for visual clarity

### Version Requirements

Always mark version-specific features:

```markdown
**Native Tests** (Terraform 1.6+, OpenTofu 1.7+)
```

## Development Workflow

### This Is Not Traditional Software

**No build/test/compile:**
- It's documentation, not code
- No automated test suite
- No build artifacts

**Validation approach:**
1. Update SKILL.md
2. Load in Claude Code (reload skills)
3. Test on real Terraform projects
4. Observe if Claude applies patterns correctly
5. Iterate based on results

### Testing Your Changes

**Before submitting a PR:**

1. **Load the updated skill:**
   ```bash
   # If you have local clone in ~/.claude/references/
   # Claude Code auto-reloads on file changes
   ```

2. **Test with real queries:**
   - "Create a Terraform module with tests"
   - "Review this configuration"
   - "What testing framework should I use?"

3. **Verify Claude references the skill:**
   - Check if new patterns appear in responses
   - Ensure no conflicts with existing guidance

4. **Check token count:**
   ```bash
   wc -c SKILL.md  # Currently ~17,700 chars ≈ 4,400 tokens
   ```

### When to Update

**Update the skill when:**
- ✅ New Terraform major/minor versions introduce features
- ✅ Community consensus emerges on patterns
- ✅ Real-world usage reveals gaps or ambiguities
- ✅ Anti-patterns discovered that should be warned against

**Don't update for:**
- ❌ Provider-specific resource changes (use MCP tools)
- ❌ Minor version patches without feature changes
- ❌ Personal preferences without community consensus

## Working with MCP Tools

When this skill is used alongside Terraform MCP server:

| Provides | Skill | MCP |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Best practices | ✅ | ❌ |
| Code patterns | ✅ | ❌ |
| Testing workflows | ✅ | ❌ |
| Latest versions | ❌ | ✅ |
| Registry docs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Module search | ❌ | ✅ |

**Together they enable:**
- Code generation following best practices
- Up-to-date version constraints
- Framework selection guidance
- Proactive anti-pattern detection

## Skill Evolution Strategy

### Maintaining Balance

As Terraform evolves, balance:
- **Completeness** vs **Token efficiency**
- **Detail** vs **Scannability**
- **Examples** vs **Reference**

**Current Status:** SKILL.md is at 524 lines, slightly above the suggested 500-line target. This is justified by:
- Comprehensive decision matrices (testing, count vs for_each)
- Essential quick reference tables
- Version-specific guidance (multiple Terraform versions)
- Progressive disclosure architecture minimizes token cost

The extra 24 lines provide significant value while maintaining scannability. Future updates should prioritize reference file expansion over core skill growth.

Current sweet spot: ~4.4K tokens for core SKILL.md, with 6 reference files (~26K tokens) providing deep-dive content on demand. Total coverage: ~30.4K tokens structured for progressive disclosure.

### Long-term Vision

This skill should:
- Stay current with Terraform/OpenTofu releases
- Remain the definitive Claude resource for Terraform
- Evolve with community consensus
- Maintain production-grade quality standards
