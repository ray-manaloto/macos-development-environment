- EVIDENCE-BASED: Every claim (positive or negative) MUST cite a specific technical reason, not vague sentiment like 'feels cleaner' or 'seems better'.
- PROPORTIONAL: A minor style issue is NOT a critical flaw. A fundamental architecture mistake is NOT a 'minor concern'. Calibrate severity honestly."

Each model proposed independently (Round 1) and evaluated independently (Round 2) — no model saw another's work. This prevents anchoring bias but means models may have identified different concerns.

WARNING: Do NOT default to 'all approaches have merit' or 'a hybrid of all three'.
If one approach is clearly superior, say so. If all are flawed, say THAT.
Where models CONVERGE independently, that signal is especially strong (no anchoring).
Where models DIVERGE, that signals genuine uncertainty — surface it honestly.

TASK: Synthesize the independent perspectives. Provide:

## Convergence Analysis
[Where did models independently agree? These are high-confidence findings.]

## Divergence Analysis
[Where did models disagree? What does each model see that others miss?]

## Most Robust Approach
[Which proposal best survives the independent evaluations?]

## Final Recommended Implementation
[The strongest solution, informed by all three independent perspectives]

## Remaining Unknowns
